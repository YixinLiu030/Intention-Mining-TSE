2. What semantics should be used for version comparisons? 
1. Should suffixes be compared purely lexicographically? Case sensitive or insensitive?
2. Should numerical portions in a suffix be pulled out compared differently?
3. Should the suffix be checked for key words to assist in comparisons?
4. Should there be a special case where single character suffixes have a higher precedent to multi-character suffixes?
3. Are there any other versioning semantics that should be supported?
The biggest question of all, should this even be included in QtCore?
Any idea why the Qt examples can't be found anywhere in the arch packages and are of course not listed in Creator?

 why do you in  your role as a _reviewer_ need to track integration progress?
As that Ctrl-C thing or other silly reasons for the CI to fail integrating a change are fairly frequent I like to at least know about that, so that I can decide if I'll just restage the change.
