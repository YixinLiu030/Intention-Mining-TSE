One problem I am going to run into is that Apple's API doesn't seem to provide error details when a certificate check fails (SecTrustEvaluate), so I don't think we'll get as fine-grained QSslError's as when using OpenSSL
It looks like there may be a problem here.
 Couple of windows packages are still missing but those will be available later today.

The following code demonstrates the problem:
 The following code demonstrates the problem:
Unfortunately for legal reasons, the Qt project is unable to bundle a copy of OpenSSL making it hard to address this weakness.
Another issue is displaying the certificate to the user
One problem with this concept is that we might end up with fragmentation of the SSL APIs
Another problem is that existing applications might not realise that the backend they're on only offers stubs for some functions. 
This is a hard problem, however we could require apps to opt-in to this proposal, with the fallback being the existing code that dlopens openssl. 
Hi all, Qt5.git integration failed in release branch; third time because of same tests :( Autotests `tst_activeFocusOnTab' and `tst_controls' failed :( see https://codereview.qt-project.org/#change,84473 .
Can someone check if those are real issues?

The only problem is current CMake integration in Qt uses INTERFACE_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES target property, when to be provide a system include directory it should use INTERFACE_SYSTEM_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES

The issue I mentioned above though cost me a lot of debugging time - and I'm someone who is fairly experienced with the language, tooling and Qt.
When I disabled Qt warnings the main issue was that we wanted implicit lossy conversions to be errors in our code but there are a number of cases where Qt did this.

If that's not the case on APPLE, then that's a bug in CMake..

 On compilers that do not support -isystem flag  CMake falls back to -I, so compatibility would not be a problem.

The problem with DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH is that you need to inject it somehow to process launching the app: (1) if we put it into Info.plist it won't work for bundle less apps (i.e. for simple testing) (2) if we put it into user's 
.bash_profile then it won't work in apps launched via Finder, as launchd does not run/respect .

 (1) if we put it into Info.plist it won't work for bundle less apps (i.e. for simple testing) Actually you CAN add Info.plist to bundle-less apps using the linker arguments: `-sectcreate __TEXT __info_plist Info.plist` which will embed it in the binary.

If I load the mexFunction by calling the entry function, Matlab crashes
In that case, Matlab crashes right after boot showing that it is the other way around: Matlab calls a QT4 function which finally ends up in libQt5Core.so.

Hi, the problem is that your Derived.qml isn't actually derived from Base.qml, since you're using 'Item'instead of 'Base' as a root item.
if it's related, it must be a bug in gerrit (the permission talks explicitly about emails, not the event stream).

Hi, inspecting the QtWebChannel code I found that a QMetaObjectPublisher object is not able to distinquish between different clients
Because of that reason the feature that property updates are only send if the client is idling is not working correctly
But the setTimeout function is not defined when including qwebchannel.js into a qml application

There is a bug in the Ubuntu install that I found back before Warty's release, but is still not fixed in Hoary
This bug (#2416). results in an incorrect hardware clock whenever the clock is set to local time in the install. It can be worked around by executing /etc/init.d/hwclock start after the install to synchronize the clock.
I would work on a fix for this bug, however I don't have much programming knowledge surrently and am thus unable to provide a fi

Evolution is very resouce intensive (frequently just sits there "Formating message") and, at least for me, crashes often
Now that I have used the Warty Install CD that was shipped out to me, Evolution can no longer send SMTP mail
I believe the problem is either that broken link or the evolution that ships on the Ubuntu Install CD.
